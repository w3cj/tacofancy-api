# Taco Fancy JSON

Parse the recipes from the tacofancy repo to create JSON with all layer data. Currently using [my forked version of the repo](https://github.com/w3cj/tacofancy) with a consistent format for recipes.

## Getting started:

To generate layers.json, update .env with your path to the tacofancy repo.

```sh
npm start
```
