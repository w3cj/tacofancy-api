What we're going to do is this: start with a base of cooked onions; start roasting the pork shoulder; add onions to keep it moist, but not too many or too fast so that they can get dry enough to caramelize.

    "notes": ["Have you handled very hot peppers before? No? Okay, listen, this is really important: hot chiles will get oil on your fingers, and it will burn any sensitive body parts you touch. That oil is very difficult to scrub off, so just washing your hands isn't enough. Dried chiles are much safer to work than fresh or freshly roasted chiles, but you can still have an awfully rough evening of pouring salene solution in your eyes if you aren't careful. When in doubt: nitrile gloves."],

    "description": "A.k.a. za‚Äòtar, za‚Äôatar, zattr, etc.\n\nZaatar is a thyme-based Middle Eastern seasoning that adapts well to tacos. It has a pleasantly dry, faintly sour/bitter flavor. It goes well on savory bases like squash and lamb, and combines with other sour seasonings like lemon juice and radish.\n\nThere are many kinds of zaatar, some quite different; this recipe is representative, not definitive.",
    "ingredients": ["4 units thyme", "2 units oregano", "2 units sesame seeds", "0‚Äì1 unit salt", "1 unit sumac (to be found at a Lebanese or Syrian market, or at a yuppie grocery; in a pinch, lemon zest can substitute)", "Other herbs to taste: fennel pollen, marjoram, cumin, etc.", "Optional: trace olive oil or lemon juice as a binder (but not if you plan to store it)"],
    "directions": ["Toast the sesame seeds. Grind all ingredients together using any method, stopping when the mixture is not too fine to pick up by pinching.", "May be added to meat during cooking, or sprinkled over a finished taco.", "The latest theories have not ruled out the possibility of a zaatar mole."],
